# Python F1 Reaction Test

This was a fun little project and all rights are @jaffathecake who created the website and this project is for personal usage and just some fun to learn new python libraries and tricks to further my python knowledge. 
<br/>
Welcome to another random project I had the thought of doing. This time it revolves around my love for F1, a few months ago I found a website where you can test your reaction's on a simulated formula 1 start light sequence. If you don't know how it works there is a traffic light type start where there will be a countdown to 5 red lights appearing and then once 5 red lights are showing there is a random interval for when all the lights go off at once and the race begins. It is a race of reaction's that you can't predicate the start of and could face a jump start penalty. 
<br/>
My average reaction score ranges from 1.5/1.6 to 1.9 on most tries however, i wondered how much quicker could a computer be than your average human. So I created code to test that.
<br/>
Reading through the code itself you will see comments that basically share information on each line and what it does and why it is there.
<br/>
TL:DR is that the code takes a look at the colour of the pixel at a certain area of the screen and if it is a said colour it will click the screen until we quit it with our keyboard press in this case 'H'. 

<br/>
The your best is the best score the code achieved after a while of running it 00.006 - truly insane. 
<br/>
This image shows which light pixel we are looking at to get the information of the colour since it's the first light to change colour.
